Taxation is the problem, not the solution.
With fewer taxes, more self-reliance and competition, a lot of the problems taxation is supposed to solve would not exist in the first place.
For example, for-profit schools might be more responsive to the needs of all children, and everyone might find it easier to earn a living wage without the tax wedge.
