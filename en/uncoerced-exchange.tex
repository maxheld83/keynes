People should not be taxed on income and wealth they have earned in uncoerced exchanges with others. If two people agree on a mutually beneficial deal, they are entitled to its fruits. For example, if someone has a special talent and offers these services to another person, and both are - respectively - richer and happier as a result, then the state should not dimish these gains.
