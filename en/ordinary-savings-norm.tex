Income from capital is not really income, it is just a compensation for endured risk and delayed gratification.
For example, if a person does not buy a thing she wants today, but only in twenty years, the interest she gets on that saving in the meantime is just a reward for her patience and willingness to absorb the risk of, say, dying early, or the bank going under.
